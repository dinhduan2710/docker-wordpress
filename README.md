# WPDC - WordPress Docker Compose

Easy WordPress development with Docker and Docker Compose.

With this project you can quickly run the following:

- [WordPress and WP CLI](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/)
- [phpMyAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/)
- [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/)

## Requirements

Make sure you have the latest versions of **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.

Clone this repository or copy the files from this repository into a new folder. In the **docker-compose.yml** file you may change the IP address (in case you run multiple containers) or the database from MySQL to MariaDB.

Make sure to [add your user to the `docker` group](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) when using Linux.

## Installation

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
docker-compose up -d 
```

## Usage

### Starting containers

You can start the containers with the `up` command in daemon mode (by adding `-d` as an argument) or by using the `start` command:

```
docker-compose start
```

### Stopping containers

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Removing containers

To stop and remove all the containers use the`down` command:

```
docker-compose down
```

Use `-v` if you need to remove the database volume which is used to persist the database:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

### Creating database dumps


### WP CLI

The docker compose configuration also provides a service for using the [WordPress CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/).

Sample command to install WordPress:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli core install --url=http://localhost --title=test --admin_user=admin --admin_email=test@example.com
```

Or to list installed plugins:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli plugin list
```

For an easier usage you may consider adding an alias for the CLI:

```
alias wp="docker-compose run --rm wpcli"
```

This way you can use the CLI command above as follows:

```
wp plugin list
```

### phpMyAdmin

You can also visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to access phpMyAdmin after starting the containers.

The default username is `root`, and the password is the same as supplied in the `.env` file.
